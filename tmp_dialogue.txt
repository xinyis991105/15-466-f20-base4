Hi there! 2
I'm Ms Balloon! 3
Shall we play a game? 32
Ah...I'll take that as a yes. 5
Let's move! 6
You know, there hasn't been a bunch of folks around these days. 7
I'm a balloon so I couldn't really move. 8
It's like when you humans lose gravity. 0
That's when you're filled with gas! But I'm not! 35
Yep! 12
Hehe you'll figure out! 12
See these floating balls? 13
These are my supplies! 14
But I couldn't tell which are good and which are bad... 15
Can you help me distinguish and get these? 36
I think someone said the ones making bass sounds are bad... 17
But I can't tell cuz I'm a balloon! 18
Do you know what a bass is? 37
Great! Let's start! 44
Oh no! What did you do??? 21
Why would you do this to me? 22
Now I'm gonna shrink to nothing... -1
Thank you so much! 24
To return your favor 25
I'm gonna tell you what I'm filled with. 26
There is actually a curse in this space. 27
I live on genki, vitality air, as you might call it, of people. 28
The curse is that, whoever helps me gets turned into this little floating ball... 39
I'm sorry, but that's all the meaning to my being... 40
Just like how you humans have to go to school, work, get married, that kind of stuff... 41
Is it bass? IDK...Now just need to wait for the next one to help me with that... -1
... 4
In space, you'll blow up. 9
I see. 12
What are you filled with then? 11
But how? 16
I think so... 19
(What if I just mess around? What would happen to this balloon?) 0
... 29
... 30
(I AM starting to feel the difference. My limbs become swollen and light.) 42
(And I'm losing my perceptions...) 43
(The last sound I can make is...) 31
(Press L to listen to a ball when you are close enough.) 45
(Press P to pinch a bad ball so that Ms Balloon won't be hurt.) 46
(Press C to collect a good ball so that Ms Balloon can be supplied.) 38
